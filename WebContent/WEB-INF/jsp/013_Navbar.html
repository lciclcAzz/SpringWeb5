                        To add the responsive features to the navbar, the content that you want to be collapsed needs to be wrapped in a <div> with classes .collapse, .navbar-collapse. The collapsing nature is tripped by a button that has a the class of .navbar-toggle and then features two data- elements. The first, data-toggle, is used to tell the JavaScript what to do with the button, and the second, data-target, indicates which element to toggle. Three with a class of .icon-bar create what I like to call the hamburger button. This will toggle the elements that are in the .nav-collapse <div>. For this feature to work, you need to include the Bootstrap Collapse Plugin.
